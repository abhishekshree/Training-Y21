## Assignment 1

**Aim:** Understing nodes, topics, publishers, subscribers, and services.

**Deadline:** 17th July, 2022

**Submission Format:**
- You have to create a pull request against the `ros` branch.
- Your PR should contain the `src` folder from the workspace.
- Your PR should contain the `README.md` file with all the details about how to run your code and the procedure you followed.

Essentially the folder structure will look like:

```bash
(on branch ros)

Training-Y21
├── 200028
│   ├── README.md
│   └── src
└── README.md

```

**Task:**

1. Create a catkin workspace for the assignments. You can name it whatever you want. (e.g. `catkin_ws` the `_ws` is just a convention)
2. Create a package called `math` in the workspace.
3. You have to create a node called `input_node` that will publish the sum of two numbers as a message. For that you will have to create two ROS topics and publish the two numbers (they can be fixed, preferably random numbers). 
4. Another node `output_node` will subscribe to the topics in `input_node` and publish the sum of the two numbers in another topic.
5. Create a service called `add_two_numbers` that will add two numbers and return the sum. The service will accept two numbers from topics in `input_node` and return the sum.

## Assignment 2
**Aim:** Understanding mapping and simulating the world.

**Deadline:** 27th July, 2022

**Submission Format:**
- Create a pull request (new) against the `ros` branch.
- Your PR should contain the `src` folder from the workspace.
- Your PR should contain the `README.md` file with all the details about how to run your code and the procedure you followed.
- A **screen recording** of the simulation is required (upload it on youtube and add the link in the README). Example: [here](https://youtu.be/unzPTIgUDTg)


**Task:**

Create a new package named `demo-gazebo`. Learn about how to create world files, and create one in the package. 

a. Customize it as per your choice with the following requirements:
- A model from the default gazebo library ex: postbox.
- A custom model outside the gazebo library.
- An additional source of light
- A custom physics solver 

b. Write a launch file to visualize/load this world in the simulation environment. The launch file goes into the launch folder.

c. Learn about Robot Modelling, explicitly URDF and XACRO. 

- Create a robot using the URDF file. (You are free to refer from the internet for this one).

- To move the robot use the differential drive plugin. Configure it to move your robot.

- Spawn the robot in the world you had created and try moving it from the terminal.

- Learn about teleop key package. Use it to drive your robot.
