level 5-6: used find -type f to give normal files -size to specify the size and ! -exectable to give only non executable files.
only one such file was in the inhere directory which we accessed by cd command. then cat required file paath gave the next password.


        DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7


level 6-7: read up the man pages of find. use / after find to search entire system used -type f for file -user ot specify user -group to specify group name and -size to specify the size of the file. now only one of the files could be accessed and it contained the password. catted it to get the password.


        HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs

        IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR
 

 level 11-12: read the wiki link, found out that tr is the required command used it along with the cat command to view the file.
 first used the tr command with -t option along with the sets which define the rotation by 13. after entering the command we have to copy paste the contents of the data.txt file and the decoded output is printed.
        5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu

level 12-13: bfirst we created a directory /tmp/abir. now we are going to reverse hexdump the data.txt file. for that we copied the data.txt file into the working directory. then we used xxd -r data.txt > data to reverse hexdump the output into the data file.
now file command shows it is a gzip commpressed file so mv it to a gz file and decompress it using gzip. we can do it using the -d option. so on unzipping it we get a new file data. file command shoys it is a bzip2 compressed file. we first mv it to data.bz2 and then decompress it using bzip2 -d. then the next file data is again a gzip2 compressed file. so we mv it to data.gz and then decompress it by gzip2 -d again. the next file data that we get is a tar archive file so clearly next command is going to be a tar command. by reading man pages learnt that -xf is the ooption to extract a tar file. first mv it to data.tar and extraxted it to get data5.bin which is also a tar file. so mv it to data5.tar and extract it to get data6.bin which is a bzip2 file. so mv it to data.bz2 and decompress it using bzip2 -d. We get a file data which is a tar file again so we mv it to data.tar and extract it. next we get data8.bin a gzip file so mv and decompress it to get a data file which is finally a ASCII file ðŸ˜…. cat it to read the contents and get the next password.

        cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd


level 16-17: first used the nmap command. used the -p option to search the port within the range, it returned the ports with a server listed on them. one by one i used ncat --ssl on each of the ports to find which port returned the credentials of the next level. Only one of the ports returned a RSA private key.
