# Training-Y21-Electrical Task
Made an account on TinkerCAD.
Couldn't fully implement first task (did not understand how to use the 555 IC datasheet in conjugation with 4-bit counter)
completed the second task, used a temperature sensor and displayed the data on LCD screen, used some online resources to get correct circuit linkages. https://www.tinkercad.com/things/3EbT0UxS4dN?sharecode=u_nbS_dVc_gH25L9_FL99Dpy5cx8YEEehTbhz5JvDgw
completed the third task, simply used the starter available in tinkerCAD, got the code via online resources, varied the delay factors to change the speed of the servomotors. https://www.tinkercad.com/things/aQW1uXw9bdN?sharecode=JVfpq0udHsjnW5zcnyNkIVPAxcglByYYvsk05OhhmUk
